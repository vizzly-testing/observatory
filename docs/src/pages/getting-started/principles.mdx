# Design Principles

## Status Colors

In visual testing, color communicates critical information instantly. We use a strict color vocabulary:

| Color | Meaning | Components |
|-------|---------|------------|
| **Green** (emerald) | Approved, passed, success, active | Badge, Card, Alert, Button |
| **Amber** (amber) | Pending, review needed, warning | Badge, Card, Alert |
| **Red** (red) | Failed, rejected, error, danger | Badge, Card, Alert, Button |
| **Blue** (blue) | Informational, processing, new | Badge, Card, Alert |
| **Purple** (purple) | Special, featured, custom | Badge, Card |
| **Gray** | Neutral, default, disabled | Badge, Button |

### Never Break Color Expectations

Users learn to scan dashboards by color. A green badge should **always** mean something positive. Don't use green decoratively or for branding.

## Information Density

Visual testing generates lots of data. Our components balance density with readability:

### Progressive Disclosure

Show summaries first, details on demand:
- Card headers show key metrics
- Expandable sections reveal full data
- Modals for detailed views
- Tooltips for contextual info

### Tables for Scanning

When users need to compare many items, use tables:
- Sortable columns
- Filterable data
- Sticky headers for long lists
- Row actions on hover

### Badges for Quick Status

Badges communicate status at a glance without interrupting flow:
- Small size for inline use
- Auto-detect variant from content
- Dot indicators for emphasis

## Keyboard Navigation

Every interactive component is fully keyboard accessible:

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| `Tab` | Move focus to next element |
| `Shift+Tab` | Move focus to previous element |
| `Enter/Space` | Activate focused element |
| `Escape` | Close modal/dropdown/cancel |
| `Arrow keys` | Navigate within component |

### Focus Management

- Visible focus rings on all interactive elements
- Focus trapped in modals
- Focus restored when modals close
- Logical tab order

## Dark Theme

Observatory is built dark-first, not adapted from light:

### Color Palette

```css
--vz-bg: #0f172a;        /* Page background */
--vz-surface: #1a2332;   /* Card backgrounds */
--vz-elevated: #1e293b;  /* Elevated surfaces */
--vz-border: #374151;    /* Borders */
```

### Contrast Ratios

All text meets WCAG AA standards:
- Primary text: 15.8:1 contrast ratio
- Secondary text: 7.3:1 contrast ratio
- Interactive elements have visible focus states
